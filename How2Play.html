    <h2>How to start HearthStone</h2>
    <p>
      Firstly, Hearthstone is a turn-based card game that you play online
      against other players around the world. The first thing to know about the
      game is that it is a card collecting game. You have the choice of deciding
      what class you want to play then you can making a deck of 30 cards with it
      includes minions, spells, quests or heroes that can influence the deck
      that you decide to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now getting into the gameplay. The player is first introduced to a board
      that fit up to 7 minions on each side. The blue crystals are called Mana
      and are used as a way to play your cards. They will increase by 1 every
      turn at the start of every turn until they reach a max of 10. The user
      will start 3 or 4 cards depending if they go first or second
    </p>
    <p>
      Both players will start with 30 health points and will battle till one of
      the reaches 0 and one person concedes if not the fight will continue
    </p>

    <h2>How to improve</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to other collection games the way for someone to improve is to
      keep playing the game to expand your collection of cards and improve the
      decks that you are using to rise up the ranks to become one of the best
      players. There are certain things that people need to take into account
      when playing this game. An important thing that players need to know the
      meta that they are playing in. Meta, short for most "effective tactics
      available" in gaming terminology is a generally agreed upon strategy by
      the community. Said strategy is considered to be the most optimal way to
      win/ has the best performance at a specific task. Some people have defined
      meta as an acronym meaning “most effective tactics available. This means
      that this will genrally affect who the player base will play and what
      decks theh will play. <br />
      Another thing that you will need to know to play this game is to have a
      small sense of what does what. For exmaple, theere are certains cards that
      can do niche things and other cards that cripple you if you do something
      wrong.
    </p>

    <h2>Recognising paterns</h2>
    <p>
      Recognising paterns inside this game is somewhat useful with knowing how
      to play against and what you are playing against. After playing for a
      certain amount of time, you will see that there are ways to pin-point what
      type of deck your opponent is playing. When you learn what type of deck
      that they are playing it will change the way you play the game a ceetain
      way because you will be expecting certain cards to be played when against
      some classes.
    </p>

    <h2>Meta Waves</h2>
    <p>
      Another thing to learn about this game is what the meta is. This is
      something that can be annoying to some players becaue it will limit them
      to what they are allowed to use whe playing the game when they want to be
      more competitive when they are playing against other people. The thing
      about meta is that it is able to change in a matter of seconds during an
      next expansion (New update) because of the new cards that they can add. It
      can fully shift the meta with it being able to make decks that were
      considered a top 10 deck to one that can't even be viable in competitive
      play.
