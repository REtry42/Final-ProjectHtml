    <h2>Each class specializes on different things</h2>
    <p>
      Mage: Masters of arcane, fire and frost, mages wield formidable
      single-target and area of effect damage spells, and can freeze enemies in
      their tracks. Mages have a strong spell-synergy, capable of turning minor
      incantations into devastating Fireballs, and can employ a range of magical
      Secrets to redirect enemy effects, protect themselves from damage, or stop
      the deadliest foe or spell in its tracks. <br />
      <br />
      Paladin: Stalwart champions of the Light, wielding sturdy weapons and
      gifting the recruits of their order with Divine Shields and a range of
      powerful Blessings. Paladins can also have a range of spells to heal
      themselves or smite their enemies, weaken foes, and Secrets to protect
      vulnerable targets.<br />
      <br />
      Warlock:Calling nightmarish Demons to their aid, warlocks are willing to
      sacrifice their own life, cards, and even their own minions to overwhelm
      their enemies. Regarding their own lifeblood as nothing more than a
      currency, warlocks readily trade away their Health to draw additional
      cards, but must often pay a terrible price for the services of the
      infernal beings with whom they consort. <br />
      <br />
      Priest: Devout healers with powerful restorative abilities, Priests use
      the power of Light to sustain themselves and their allies while pacifying
      enemies, but they can also use their darker abilities to manipulate and
      destroy enemies, peering into or even seizing control of their opponents'
      minds. <br />
      <br />
      Warrior: These lords of war use heavy weaponry and deadly attacks to slam
      and devastate the battlefield. While their skill with armor and shields
      allows them to soak up the mightiest of blows, their gladiatorial
      bloodlust brings synergy with Enrage and on-damage effects, sending their
      minions charging at the enemy.<br />
      <br />
      Shaman: Masters of the elements, shamans command the service of mighty
      elementals, and even the Elemental Lords themselves. Shamans can Overload
      their mana in order to rise to the needs of the moment, with their attacks
      producing varying potency. Shamans can also summon Totems to boost their
      powers.<br />
      <br />
      Rogue: Subtle and evasive assassins, using flurries of swift sharp strikes
      to slice and incapacitate enemies, rogues prefer to wield light daggers,
      laced with deadly poisons. Rogues prefer to assault their opponents in
      rapid bursts of activity, activating Combos to gain powerful additional
      effects.<br />
      <br />
      Druid: Shapeshifting protectors of the wild, with powerful Taunt minions
      and adaptable Choose One effects, druids are also able to accelerate their
      rate of mana accumulation, allowing them to access high-mana-cost cards
      earlier than their opponents. Druids are a versatile class, capable of
      using the forces of nature and primal rage to crush their enemies or
      empower their allies.<br />
      <br />
      Hunter: Trackers and huntsmen, with a synergy with Beasts, a selection of
      bows, and a supply of cunning deadly traps, hunters never miss their mark.
      Whether unleashing their Beasts upon the enemy or sniping them from afar,
      hunters possess relentless and immediate damage capabilities.<br />
      <br />
      Death Knight: Fallen champions of the Scourge who fight with cursed
      Runeblades. Death Knights have access to great power, but must choose what
      three Runes they wish to draw power from -- Blood to drain life and
      fortify themselves, Frost to manipulate mana and freeze foes, or Unholy to
      raise corpses and enhance their undead allies.<br />
      <br />
      Demon Hunter: Agile fighters who call upon demonic allies and fel magic.
      Outcasts of society, Demon Hunters attack with their blades and claws,
      using fallen allies to fuel their power. Not ones to shy away from a
      fight, Demon Hunters specialize in granting their hero Attack damage for
      one turn.<br />
