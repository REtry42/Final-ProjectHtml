      <h2>What is Hearthstone</h2>
      <p>
        Hearthstone is an online digital collectible card game developed by
        Blizzard Entertainment. This game takes the lore from the game
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>
        by using the same characters, elements and relics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using
        constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected hero with a unique
        power. Players use their limited mana crystals to play abilities or
        summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying the
        opponent's hero. Winning matches and completing quests earn in-game
        gold, rewards in the form of new cards, and other in-game prizes.
        Players can then buy packs of new cards through gold or
        microtransactions to customize and improve their decks. The game
        features several modes of play, including casual and ranked matches,
        drafted arena battles, and single-player adventures. New content for the
        game involves the addition of new card sets and gameplay, taking the
        form of either expansion packs or adventures that reward the player with
        collectible cards upon completion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast to other games developed by Blizzard, Hearthstone was an
        experimental game developed by a smaller team based on the appreciation
        of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid
        the pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any
        possible plays from an opponent during a player's turn and by
        replicating the feel of a physical card game within the game's user
        interface. Many of the concepts as well as art assets were based on
        those previously published in the physical World of Warcraft Trading
        Card Game.
